# A11y Camp
### 13/09/2017

## Room 1 - The Great a11y Bakeoff - Cordelia McGee-Tubb, Salesforce
- a11y is about making products, spaces and services that everyone can use and enjoy in all contexts, regardless of their abilities
    - visual – temp(surgery) or permanent(injury, birth), Blind, colourblind, low light situation, low battery
    - Motor – What peripherals are they using? RSI? Busy hands?
    - Auditory – Hearing? Loud room?
    - Cognitive – Learning? Language? Unfamiliar UI?
- Bake a11y in, don't tack on
- Jab in the blueberries at the end and it's _technically_ a blueberry muffin, but not a very good or presentable one.
- Everyday as web creators, whether we've signed up or not, we're contestants in the great a11y bakeoff
- You should approach a11y with the same enthusiasm as bakeoff contestants – amateur, but passionate
    - Be comfortable with basic techniques, but open to challenge
- Recipe
    - Semantic HTML
        - div, span, a (don't carry much meaning) vs button, article, input, table, main, ul, nav, li, a[href], h1, h2, section
            - used correctly, communicates to assistive technology how a page's elements relate to each other
        - ideally, you could build an accesible site with just this, but as more pages are becoming apps...
    - ARIA
        - Accessible Rich Internet Applications
        - Attributes that can communicate *role*, *state* and *properties*
        - Like cinnamon, you can put too much on and make it unpleasant. Really useful when used correctly.
    - Alt attributes
        - two types:
            - Informational (alt="cupcake with sprinkles")
            - Redundant or decorative (alt="")
                - For images not essential for understanding the page
            - Use wisely
    - names for all interactive items
    - text contrasts
        - 4.5:1 for regular text
        - 3:1 for large text
    - mouse-keyboard parity
- Judging criteria
    - Does it look amazing?
    - Does it function as expected?
    - Did you over/under engineer it?
    - Test everything with 
        - a mouse
        - keyboard
        - multiple screenreaders (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
        - grayscale mode
        - real users
- How to make the best, most accessible form
    - The fields
        - input[type]
    - Associated visual labels
        - label element
        - label[for] to link label to input[id]
            - This will also trigger associated input
        - Never use placeholder text as label
    - Visible focus indicators
        - Default focus indicator can be ugly, don't just remove default. Put your own in.
    - Associated errors
        - input[aria-describedby] which associates itself with the error's ID
    - No color reliance
        - Red for error styles might not be visible in grayscale – iconography can help
- Technical challenge – Treeview example
    - Treeview example – folders and nodes that can expand and collapse
    - Tried and true semantic html isn't sufficient
    - Check ARIA recipe – Aria Authoring Practices
        - includes standard aria attrs, keyboard interactions, roles etc.
        - Sometimes things are missing, still requires testing.
            - double check the spec
            - google it – check for known bugs
                - whoseline.a11yideas.com/bugs.html
            - ask around!
                - web-a11y.herokuapp.com
        - div[role="tree", aria-activedescendent=""] etc etc
- Showstopper challenge - drag & drop
    - consider precision, interaction etc.
    - think less about the method, consider the outcome
        - It's "move things", not "drag and drop"
    - Salesforce drag&drop lets you move tickets into kanban swim columns
        - Click and drag to column
        - Press space, select column from list to move it to
    - Rearrange a list
        - Space to enter drag mode, arrow keys to move up and down, space to drop
    - ARIA had drag and drop authoring practices in 1.0, but have disappeared in 1.1
        - don't worry too much, get creative with common interactions
            - e.g. "delete" button to move to delete bucket
        - Give the user choice and flexibility, they'll decide what's best for them


## Room 1 - AI: The Promise of Ubiquitous A11y? - David Masters, Microsoft

## Room 1 - Fill In The A11y Gaps With Proper Reporting - Herin Hentry
- Availability is not a11y
    - avail = presence
    - a11y = equal access
- A11y can also be functional requirement
- Keyboard testing != screen reader testing
- We think everything is under control, but we aren't really monitoring it
- a11y testing
    - WCAG Evaluation Methodology 1.0
        - WCAG 2.0 defines conformance for an individual set of pages but doesn't describe how to evaluate entire pages
        - claims can't be made for whole sites based on eval of a selected subset
        - claim applicable when all pages in the scope of comnformance have been evaluated
    - Will fixing detailed report + Automated results make the app completely accessible?
        - Estimate | Fix | Retest | Regression | Second Evaluation
    - Flawed Process
        - increases cost
        - breaks existing functionality
    - How to avoid flaw
        - early a11y checks
        - check process from micro to macro level
            - Identify component list
            - Create a11y support dataset for each component with a11y support
            - test each component individually
            - Macro -- test entire page
            E.g. Link
            - Persistent keyboard focus? - if I change contrast, will I lose focus?
            - Clear name?
            - Semantic link?
        - What are the things I need to check on a link? What is the success criteria?
            - Project managers might want success criteria, designers might want styleguide, devs might want interaction
            - Combining excel spreadsheet of devices, browsers, component success criteria
            - Mark results in separate column, extract as pivot table – track pass/fail rate of each component test you've run
        - What is the benefit of this?
            - Time consuming
            - Reporting is more detailed, and choice is more conscious
            - spreadsheet of checks is more consumable and shareable due to context
            - assists in regression testing
            - personalised view of reporting
            - reusable a11y support data set
            - Measurable a11y – assists PMs and devs in estimation
            - include reporting in project lifecycle
            - transparent, accountable, inclusive
    - Success in any project depends on visibility, communication and translation
        - delayed reporting of a11y issues causes loss of information later in project
        - Interlock testing and reporting throughout project lifecycle, and keep it rolling!

- Persistent labeling – when you move into something, know where you are
- Predictable mouse movement – a path that a mouse user takes, will probably be the path a keyboard or other user takes

- Talking to everyone's "own world" encourages better reception cross teams. Increase accountability and understanding to encourage participation.

## Room 2 - Sneaking A11y Into Your Product - Ben Buchanan, Ansarada
- We are the believers – we believe a11y is the right thing to do, and we will make it work inherently.
    - Reality is, it's just not a priority
    - Our role is to become an advocate for a11y
- Do not make "it's the right thing" the basis of your strategy
    - What's gonna get the decision maker to say "yes"
        - Become the decision maker (lol)
- To advocate effectively, you have to see the entire business
    - how's the budget? how does the business's requirement trickle down to your responsibility?
    - features
        - no features = no money
    - Security
        - Insecure products can be dangerous
    - A11y
    - Performance
    - Usability
- Think like a CEO
    - Enhances product
    - Lowers risk
    - increases cost
    - increases revenue?
- A11y should be business as usual
    - Whatever the existing schedule is, fit into it
    - It's not special, it _must be done_ like everything else.
- Opportunity wears overalls and looks like work
    - Make a11y part of standards or styleguides
    - Make sure it's written down somewhere
    - There's some kind of report someone's writing you every month, make sure a11y is part of that.
    - if it's not accessible, it's not good code. It's not high quality.
- Try to bake in at the start. Get in early so it gets in at estimates, resourcing, profiling for people working on the project.
    - That can be hard, but if you can, do it
- Include a11y in hiring. But, hire people who don't know, but are keen.
    - If someone's antagonistic, it doesn't matter what to, they shouldn't be on your team.
- Budget for testing tools and auditing
    - Contractors?
- Vision
    - The idea -- what does success look like? If you don't know your target, how do you know you've hit it?
    - You can make plans. You can figure out how to meet resistance.
    - Sometimes the right strategy is openly pushing a loud agenda, Sometimes it's being sneaky
        - Sneaky = being quiet at the right time. Don't break trust, only do things you're willing to communicate.
        - Trust is easier to break than gain
    - Demonstrate you can do and achieve things, this builds allegiances.
- A11y code is not only "morally superior"
    - better for testing
    - feature-rich – e.g young fit people who work long hours and become keyboard power users
- Reframe
    - We need to add accessibility testing => Let's include accesibility in our testing suite
    - We need to report on a11y compliance => Let's include compliance in quality metrics
- Don't argue opinions, argue results
    - > "If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine"
- Calculate compound risk
    - Car has 30,000 parts but you need criticals to run
        - if 10 parts have 5% chance of failure, it's not a 95% success rate – it's .95^10 == 40%
    - JS component with 1% chance of failure * 10 = 10% chance it's gonna mess up
- Case study -- a11y at Ansarada
    - 10 years legacy
    - Chaotic design and UI
    - Every page had a11y errors
        - Turning on reporting build would be 100% bad, would be useless to business.
    - Controls with no text
    - No keyboard a11y
    - a11y is an integral part of what we call high quality UI
    - Normalize ui of product – ACE
        - roll out UI as product
        - Bake a11y into library
    - we should do a11y reviews the same way that companies do hacker audits
        - third party auditing our interactions – "It's not just my opinion"
    - Resistance
        - third party audit (high)
        - UI benchmarks (medium)
    - Breaking ACE means breaking your product
        - Push to have a11y baked deeply into QA – becomes a normal part of your puzzle
    - Next
        - Extend ACE debugger
        - Full a11y testing
- Takeaways
    - Play the long game
    - start wherever you can
    - reframe a11y
    - be an opportunist
    - build trust, expand

## Room 1 - ARIA and custom component showdown - Sarah Pulis and Adem Cifcioglu
- Five examples of conversation between Sarah and Adem re: WCAG/ARIA vs custom components
    - bad button markup. All buttons and radio buttons have no keyboard.
        - Fix all interactions with Aria?
            - No, that's what a button's for.
        - Costs less not to change elements, coz unit tests don't have to change.
        - ARIA won.
    - Repaired with aria roles, but you should be using native elements if you can.
    - Higher development effort for custom components compared with native elements.
    - You should do more assistive tech testing if you use custom components.
    - With heavy reliance on ARIA, only tested on one version of JAWS, with NVDA as fallback

    - Accessible autocorrect
        - Have you read the spec?
            - spec is shitty
        - We should have role="combobox"
            - spec 1.0 says on container, 1.1 says on the field
            - Not good JAWS support
        - Things that users usually expect for editing state aren't present
    - Usability testing is a must to understand UX
    - UX always trumps standards and guidelines
    - Sometimes, break the rules for the greater good

    - bad menu markup. role="menubar" when there's no actual link to visit, only a trigger to expand a menu
    - Less is often more. Not everything needs an aria attribute.
    - Beware the unintended consequences of applying aria attributes which overrride native semantics.
    - New interaction patterns may not be clear to all users.
        - more often than not, menu bars are navigated by keyboard
        - People in a website view often use tab, and use level 1 menu to expand a submenu
            - annoying that a top menu both triggers a submenu, and goes to another page
            - If that's the only way to navigate, you've blocked people. WCAG won't fail it though.
    
    - tab roles
        - Code is super compliant, flawless code.
        - Usability extremely questionable
            - Tab into tablist, then navigate between tabs. No further visibility/instruction?
            - What does this component _really_ do?
        - We might think interaction patterns transfer from operating systems to web, but it doesn't always happen
        - When do we expect users to understand a new interaction model?

    - abbr
        - [title] meant to display expanded title of abbreviation
        - Not keyboard accessible, can be failed by WCAG
            - dirty hack: tabindex on an abbrev element?
        - Not only customcomponents and ARUA that can be questionable
        - Always default back to what's better for the user

- Like Cordelia says, a spoonful of cinammon isn't nice. A sprinkling can do wonders.

## Room 1 - Standardising a11y using Tenon.io - Peter Bui
- Problem: Onboarding new devs into a11y
    - a11y unknown, usually not even taught, particularly in asia.
    - improving their code by standardising output, and giving them tools.
- a11y toolbox @ PB Web Development
    - boilerplate theme generator
        - semantic markup
        - Base level of a11y css,
            - fontsize
            - contrast
            - padding
        - Aria Landmarks
        - Menus with correct text and markup e.g. Menu next to the burger menu
        - Skip menus
    - gravity forms a11y plugins
        - WCAG 2.0 Form fields for gravity forms
        - form multi step process indicator
        - creates field sets for radio and checkboxes
        - adds aria attributes for form fields
        - displays errors at the top with anchors to errored fields
    - HTML codesniffer from squiz
        - browser plugin
        - test anything it finds on screen, gives false positives
        - requires interpretation and experience
        - inline displays of both errors, and what element triggered the error
    - tenon.io
        - API driven testing
        - tests only what tenon believes a machine can test
        - testing automation
    - Access Monitor for Wordpress
        - Post lauch tool
        - schedules reports and tests within website
        - stops publishing of pages that don't meet a11y requirements
    - Lots of automated scripts
- Testing
    - back in the day:
        - Milestone testing with waterfall dev cycle
    - Moving more to agile
        - test early, test often. Less to fix.
- Testing with Tenon
    - Webpage source testing
        - 74 tests run against live production URL
    - API to trigger testing
        - using postman
        - can pass to api to test on viewports
        - Can automatically push all issues found to Github Issues, with detailed descriptions
    - Tenon-cli to test in builds
        - Outputs testing report document
    - Schedule monitoring
        - Set up monitoring of changes on site, like content updates
            - JS compares with previous content, and runs a tenon test to check for passing build
            - Only tested when a visitor visits the page
    - Access Monitor
        - Create scheduled tenon reports to particular pages as a Wordpress plugin
        - errors get overlayed over actual page when logged into wordpress

- Dynamic web apps
    - It will only test whatever it can generate in the dom.
    - If tenon can see the js's output, it can test it.

## Room 1 - Welcome to the WCAG Parade – adding a11y checks into automated testing to catch errors earlier - Samuel Spencer, CSIRO
- Aristotle Metadata registry wasn't a11y compliant
- "I can't see your website" === I can't use your website
- a11y is a cycle you're trapped in again and again
    - By coming here, you've committed that you'll make a11y websites forever
- As a dev, repetition is a problem
    - Continuous Integration set up to test before releasing
    - Can't always test a11y.
        - A lot of the testing tools are browser based, and user driven
- introducing WCAG Zoo
    - works with dev/private servers
    - checks media breakpoints through command line
    - CLI
    - zookeeper
        - molerat: checks for contrast
        - anteater: checks for alt tags
        - Ayeaye: checks for accessible key interactions
        - Glowworm: checks to make sure focus states are working
        - Tarsier: checks for correctly structured headings
        - parade: runs all together
    - "strict mode"
        - makes sure access keys work, doesn't ignore them
- Checks any HTML you can generate in the CI process
    - Takes a long time, but it works
    - Site will continue to be accessible, as a dev I don't have to run these tests again
    - Identified and corrected issues with Bootstrap and ReadTheDocs
- Caveats
    - Slow
        - waiting for headless browsers to be better...
    - Algorithmic
        - Subjective tests like cognitive guidelines, understandable text can't be tested
    - Incomplete
        - But it's better than nothing

## Room 2 - Inclusive User Research - Monica Regalado
- Why?
    - Aging population, a11y needed
- Inclusivity not part of discovery phase, usually
    - possibly unless part of target market
- Acknowledge that disabled/a11y-dependent users 
- Talk to people who may help you with inclusion.
    - SMEs
    - Diversity teams in companies
- Generate empathy, foster in your team
    - Understanding what people may face can inspire ideas. Empathy isn't always completely inherent
    - Facebook's Empathy labs
        - Not to test facebook, but understand users
- Be mindful, and aware
    - Is the interview environment accessible?
    - Am i being sensitive about discussion topics? Am I bringing up trauma?
    - Is there a way to make an environment more comfortable?
- Results in more thoughtful interviews. Better communication skills.
- Evaluation
    - Testing with real users is usually more beneficial than automated test.
        - AutoTesting doesn't give detailed feedback on how to fix problems
        - e.g. Semantic headings might be correct, but misinterpreted by screenreaders
    - Compliance != Good user experience
        - Even though a list of links might be technically accessible, they'd be incredibly hard to tab through and navigate
- Conclusion
    - It's our collective responsibility to ensure inclusion in design and research. This ensures the best, most future proof product. 

## Room 1 - Performant, accessible animations with CSS & a dash of JavaScript - Wing Ho
- What does CSS animations have to do with a11y?
    - Screen that slides in from the bottom, appears on screen.
        - performs well, looks fine for purpose of demo.
- Performance
    - Browser rendering
        - 60fps
            - Common refresh rate of ~60hz on digital displays
            - 16ms each frame
            - exceeding this causes jitter/stutter
        - Render cycle
            - JS, Style > Layout > Paint > Composite
            - When a layout change occurs (CSS or JS), browser has to do the composite step all over again
            - Expensive (slow to complete)
        - Paint cycle
            - Same, but only for background color etc.
        - Composite
            - Cheapest for performance
            - limit to opacity and transform
            - Hits 60ms better
    - Why?
        - High end laptop vs Low end mobile device
        - Performance gains universal
            - Battery life
            - Improved Engagement
            - Smoother experience
- A11y
    - Animating opacity: still appears in the dom. Screen readers will still pick it up.
        - display: none doesn't take up space in the dom
        - visibility: hidden takes up space still, hides from screen reader
        - Display none has no start point for animation, since the element is not technically painted to the dom
        - Visibility property can be transitioned, you can delay the animation to take advantage
        - Not scalable when delaying multiple properties
    - JS
        - Listen for transitionend or animationend elements
        - Add transitioning class for when transition is made
    - Which is best?
        - Consider whether the element needs to stay in the flow
        - Still need JS to toggle aria attrs
- Accessible Modals
    - Tend to be fixed/absolute -relative to document body
    - Handle user focus
    - aria-roles "dialog, alertdialog" include focusable child element
    - Make sure user can close the modal
- Performant
    - Restrict transitions to transforms or opacities when possible
    - Use "will-change" sparingly for final optimisations
- Accessible
    - Ensure elements represented are consistent
    - Ensure keyboards aren't trapped in modals
    - Fix opacity animations with (visibility:hidden/display:none) + aria-hidden="true"

## Room 1 - Mobile Accessibility - Gian Wild
- This is a 15 min version of a 45 min talk. For more info, see slides in link:
    - http://pz.tt/desertmobile
- AccessibilityOz
    - 65% impaired staff
    - Not just about vision impairment
        - lots of work for making things accessible for screenreaders
        - OzPlayer
        - OzArt
        - OzWiki
- Mobile A11y features
    - Native screenreaders
        - Talkback (android)
        - Narrator (windows)
        - VoiceOver (iOS)
    - Text-to-speech/speech recog
    - Volume control
    - Vibration feedback
    - Zoom
- There is some correlation between WCAG2 and mobile sites
    - WCAG2 doesn't specifically cover mobile apps, but it is in 2.1
    - You can have completely unusable mobile experiences which are WCAG2 compliant
- Mobile usage exceeded pc usage in 2014
- Percentage of screen reader users that use mobiles very high
- PDFs – not mobile friendly
    - Adobe apparently actioning this
    - Larger file sizes + slower connection = longer download, increased data usage = unhappy customers
- Mobile sites
    - Useful for high interactivity/high data desktop sites
    - Jamies recipes - when you first enter, forces open a video without captions. When it finishes playing, you're stuck there
- Continuous movement
    - Takes up screen realestate, distracting
- Onscreen keyboard traps
    - Tab into video/form, Can't dismiss keyboard
- Hover trap
    - hover on desktop can trigger events which are undismissable on mobile
- Voiceover trap
    - some pages don't recognise swipe for navigation when using voiceover
- Touch trap
    - Cannot move the screen unless you touch the up arrow
- Keyboard
    - Don't make up your own elements – use standard input
- Text sizes
    - don't make it too small – large phones make that content almost unreadable, specifically when you disable pinch zoom
- Text size settings
    - supporting text size changes, test container sizes
    - in-app settings -- be wary of it overriding device settings
- Contrast
    - amazon's search bar is almost invisible on mobile
- Functionality
    - Kmart - shop catalog was flash app
    - Airbnb – maps fail at zooming on mobile webapp, takes u to desktop, lose all your info
- Source order
    - Provide your users with the options available to them.
    - Apple install app - install button disabled, with tiny illegible writing at the bottom explaining why
- Touch targets
    - Avoid the zoom of doom
        - triggering touch on small frames outside map to register zoom, would constantly scroll
    - Be aware of small touch targets on mobile, when moving to smaller screens
    - touch isn't activated till your finger is removed, this allows for scrolling
        - Coles site triggers on first touch
- Spacing
    - if you're gonna have opposed options, don't have them close together
- Capitalization
    - Screenreaders read capitalized text differently
- Search
- Images
    - Make sure mobile images actually work on mobile. Don't squish images.
- Testing
    - Test everything
- Elaborate with slides online, there are also positive stories there :)

## Room 2 - WCAG 2.1 Update - Andrew Arch, Intopia
- Due out mid next year
    - fairly stable as of last night's release
- History
    - WCAG 1.0 - 5/5/1999 
    - WCAG 2.0 - 11/12/2008
    - Mobile & congnitive task forces established late 2013
        - Cognitive related to perception of screen with cognitive disabilities, rather than interaction
    - Low vision task force established August 2015
    - WCAG 2.1 Announced October 2016
    - WAI Silver (AG) task force established November 2016
- WCAG 2.1 
    - 4 principles
    - 3 new guideluines
        - pointer accessible
        - additional sensor inputs
        - speech
    - success criteria
        - 4 @ A
        - 9 @ AA
        - 2 @ AAA
_Note: There was way too much info in these slides, but I tried to take down the references. For more information, see [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/)_
- Guideline 1.3 - Adaptable
    - SC 1.3.4 Contextual Information (AAA)

    - SC 1.4.13
        - Requires author not to interfere with user style sheets for text appearance
    - SC 1.4.14
        - Content triggered by hover or focus doesn't obscure the trigger, and can be moved

    - SC 2.5.3
        - Target is at least 44x44 px for pointer inputs except
            - if available through an equivalent link at least 44x44
