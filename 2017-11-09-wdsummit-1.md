## Keynote - Chris Messina - Lessons from the Death of the Personal Computer
- We as makers of the future have a huge responsibility to determine where this goes next
    - Opportunity to think fresh, leave behind outmoded ideas
    - Easy to change tech, hard to change behaviour
- "Describe a Computer to someone that's never seen one"
    - Steve Jobs, 1983 - "simple machines, electrons over gears" – relating to combustion engine
        - Minimised the amount of physical tasks – electron minimises the amount of psychological tasks
- "Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man" - Marshall McLuhan
- "The Medium is the Message"
    - TV allowed for replays of sport, which was like time travel – made sport mass consumed, and analytical
- PC designed during era of "information warfare"
    - Information you had that your enemy didn't know you have. Less about your brawn.
    - Computers at the time were designed for experts
    - Engelbart produced report for Augmenting Human Intellect, funded by Airforce
        - Proposed/demonstrated most technology we're using today
- Late 70s – Bill Gates brought advancements from expert environment, into the office.
    - Absorbed the language of the era to make things accessible.
        - e.g. "Folders", "Desktop", "Files"
- 2007 – The real "Personal Device" – Apple iPhone.
    - Took learnings from last 20 years, broke traditions, set road for next 10 years at least.
    - "Sea change" in the type of user that can use computing
- Facebook – "declarative model for interaction and connection for people"
    - Mash enough keys, you'll connect with someone.
    - Messaging drives mobile – but only 2bil people have entered that market.
- Businesses have to learn to open up to integration
    - API-driven ecosystem. Apps to talk to businesses and request data to give to user.
- Voice enabled more accessible interaction to new users
    - People can get lazier about expressing their desires, computer will understand.
    - "The death of brand is here" – non-brand searches increasing exponentially.
        - "Alexa, buy batteries". Not "Buy Energizer AA Lithium-ion batteries"
    - Voice computing needs to become a lot more "intimate". When you express desires, computers need to be there
        - "Race to be inside your mind"
- So what's gonna happen?
    - We're in the era of the electron, ending the chapter of the PC.
        - the Electron is malliable, "The difference is emphasis"
    - Increasingly able to interact with a great variance of devices
        - Also becoming more personal
            - Tv is 1:Many, everything is becoming 1:1.
    - Children age 0-8
        - 90% have a mobile device at home
        - usage since 2011 went up from 5 mins to 45.
        - Growing up experiencing their friends and family through screen.
            - How does this change human connection? "Is Grandma real?"
        - Growing up in a "more plastic world"
            - Different way of experiencing and controlling technology we never had.
        - "Miquela" – Artificial, but people are interacting with her
            - Kids will believe in the artificial, especially when the alternative is preferable to reality.
        - "Emoji Karaoke"
            - Capability of bringing yourself into digital
            - As computer imagery gets better, we believe/trust it less.
                - "Fake news about fake news"
        - As adults we're clearly not ready, what will the next generation be like?
    - "We've failed our way to success"
        - By connecting everyone, we just thought things would work themselves out on their own.
        - How important is truth and objective reality? We have to think about human experience better than we are now.
"We Shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us" – Marshall McLuhan
- If you imagine the innocence kids bring, there's hope for us yet.

## Amir Shevat (@ashevat) –  From Web & Mobile to Messaging - To Bot or not to Bot
- Biggest fear in the US is public speaking
    - It's better to be dead than to read the obituary
    - "Superhero pose" exercise to switch from positive adrenaline to negative adrenaline
- Conversational ui on the rise
    - Moved from paper, to PC, to web, to mobile, to convo
    - When to bot, and when to not?
- Conversational interfaces
    - UX that exposes products and services to users through conversational engagement and rich interactions
        - As an entrepreneur: "What is the service I'm exposing?" to decide whether it should be conversational
    - Amy:
        - Amy sets up meetings based on emails and calendar availability.
        - People don't believe she's software.
    - Alexa:
        - "What's the weather like?" in the morning
        - Moved shopping to Alexa within 2 months of bringing into the home.
    - statsbot:
        - Slackbot that connects to multiple datasources
        - Data drawn using conversational questions and a delightful experience.
            - Would take a lot of context switching otherwise
- Communication is the core of what we do at work
    - Many tools and services that aren't neccesarly communications.
        - Requires context switching, distractions etc.
    - Slack wants to be the platform for conversational interactions with those tools and services.
        - 6m users, 10h active, 2.5h content generation
        - 155,000 devs with keys used every week
        - 55% users outside US
        - 90% of paid teams use avg 8 bots daily
    - Notification: Tips and tricks
        - Format your responses
        - Digest, don't spam
        - Consider the use of Emojis
            - Can denote process and cultural aspects, not just emotion
    - Slash commands
        - Consider delayed responses
        - Thoughtful naming
            - last command definition will overwrite initial command
        - Link user profiles
- "Everybody's botshit crazy"
    - everyone in SF is building a bot
    - Why are there so many menial tasks that should be pleasant, but aren't being fixed?
        - What if we all had personal assistants that did everything for us, particularly the unpleasant stuff? That is the appeal of bots
    - Howdy + Botkit
        - o/s project for building bots
    - Tips
        - Support "feedback" and "help"
            - Always give the user an out. Don't block them, help them understand how to engage.
            - Direct user feedback is powerful
        - Thoughtful Onboarding
            - Nobody uninstalls a bot, they ignore it.
            - Super critical to teach the user what to do, and to engage with your bot.
        - Use rich interactions!
            - Think about the conversation as a funnel
            - We don't want to talk to software, we want to get stuff done. What's the minimal amount of steps?
            - e.g. Greenhouse interaction, adding buttons to conversation to approve/disprove hire.
            - Dialogs added to Slack to allow for rich interaction
- api.slack.com
- Bot when it's short and contextual
    - When the funnel of conversation is better than the funnel of not conversing 

## Lauren Lucchese (@laurenlookayz) - Designing Conversations
- Conversation – "living together", "manner of conducting oneself in the world"
- Essential in trust, happiness and quality of life.
    - e.g. conversing with Doctors, Journalists, UX designers...
    - Unlike doctor/patient, we can't always have 1:1 communications
- Engaging in dialog is essential to find out how our conversation is perceived.
    - particularly for moving from physical to digital
    - this tells us if we are building trust
- Trust must be earnt, but is hard to keep
    - Including in digital experiences. Not impossible.
- Words and content are fundamental to delivering the right message to the right person at the right time
    - Content IS design – creates meaningful experiences at every touchpoint
- Three pillars:
    - Is this natural language?
        - Will people understand this? Is this jargon?
        - What words do people use to describe what they're doing? Can we mirror it back to them?
    - What use case are we designing for?
        - Where has this person come from? What are they doing here? What are they trying to do next?
    - In what context is this most relevant?
        - Are you aware of all of the implications that this action might have?
        - Are you aware of everything that's happening to you as a result of this action? Why? When?
- Entire design flow is started in a *Word Document*
    - Map the conversation from end to end, where do you want it to go?
        - Forces us to communicate in a way that makes the user confident
    - Word docs are tested with users before anyone prototypes or wireframes
    - Optimise for understandability, then usability
- If we want to solve for customer's needs, we need to know our customers, and be masters of the conversation
    - Increasing conversion, decreasing call rates – increasing trust.
- These pillars are platform agnostic – use for articles, websites, chatbots.
- CUI = Any UI that mimics chatting with a real human.
    - You're talking on your temrs, not the computers'.
    - Chatbots + devices like siri, cortana, alexa
- When the ui goes away, words are the interface. Choose them wisely.
- AI can learn from conversations had
    - Can demonstrate that it knows you
    - Can reveal that it knows too much about you
    - This is dangerous, design carefully.
- 97% of US smartphone consumers still use SMS
    - Eno is a chatbot that allows you to bank via SMS.
        - Check your balance etc. via text.
- Designing bot conversations
    - Don't boil the ocean
        - Be strategic, don't do everything just coz you can.
        - Solve a few acute customer problems.
        - Constantly incorporate user feedback, make sure you research and bring back to the bot.
            - Eno learned many immediately applicable lessons during pilot
            - Really critical to fail gracefully
            - Design should be ever present – start with data, move from there
        - Leverage the right insights at the right time
            - Using algorithms to understand when to provide contextually relevant communication
            - Conversations are good when they're predictive, rather than reactive
                - Less robotic and cold, invokes emotion
    - Design a character that people can connect with
        - >6bn texts sent in US
            - part of this is because we know the user on the other end, so we enjoy it
            - Knowing this person makes the conversation meaningful
        - Lark - Automated, personalised health coach for people with chronic conditions
            - "Always has your back"
            - >1m people love and trust Lark
        - Go beyond the transactional back-and-forth, illicit emotional connection
            - Feeling like we can relate == feeling like we are understood
        - Soldiers assigned genders, names, personalities to bots. Thereby forming attachments.
            - Empathy when bots were damaged, funeral for destroyed bots
            - They were not becoming so attached to interfere with their mission or connection to other humans
            - Robots were easily anthropomorphized, for soldiers to make sense of their unfamiliar relationship
        - How might we achieve a true connection between our AI and the customer?
        - Character integrity is everything
            - Mood swings, unpredictability == unrelatability
        - It all starts with a story
            - Core character traits can be brought out through backstory, relatability
            - Does your bot have a gender? What principles guided that?
            - What is your bots name?
            - What are its emotional boundaries?
            - What will it stand for/against?
        - Bots are not always gonna do everything for everyone
            - Provide alternatives, broad responses
        - Boundaries
            - When to speak or listen
            - When to ask or tell
            - When to open or close
            - When to act or wait
        - Designing for a relationship
            - Can't be one sided
    - Ethical design _matters_
        - principles and ethics that guide the work that you do
            - Humanity
                - Personal conversations
                - Care and compassion that make interactions feel meaningful
                - Emulate empathy to bring humanity to the experience
                - Proper grammar and punctuation matter.
                - People love emojis.
                - Feel the moment, know your audience.
            - Clarity
                - Intentional design to focus energy on information that is most relevant at that moment.
                    - Take care of the customer's main goal first. Reiterate the question.
                    - Then, add more info or links or context.
                - Clarity != brevity, but be concise first, then playful.
            - Transparency
                - Be clear about benefits and limitations.
                - Be upfront about data collection and usage.
- Character and story takes data and insights and turns it into trust and meaningful conversation
    - Relationships rooted in understanding
    - Not cold and trustless interactions
- We're all still learning as we go, no interaction is perfect yet.
    - People say thanks to Eno, which is not necessary but is polite. So respond accordingly
    - Commands are fine, but people choose to start with a greeting

## Mark Dalgleish - DesignOps: The future of Design, as a Service
- DesignOps – an inevitable progression.
    - Static styleguide -> Design system
    - Engineers embedded in a design team. A bridge between design and engineering.
    - Design systems would no longer be in the cracks
    - Catching on as a term
- Web Design is changing
    - 1999 - "Web designer" did everything
    - then, web design and dev went their separate ways.
    - photoshop -> skeuomorphic, then _flat design_.
        - Ensured we were good at basics of design
        - Rethink how we design for web
    - Repeatable patterns allowed for Sketch to take off as preferred tools
        - Symbols for repeated UI elements
        - Scoped for each document
        - sharing symbols across projects is essential
            - went from copy pasting between docs, to copy paste from dropbox
            - Plugin suite "Craft" (by invision) tries to solve this using library plug, centralized for all symbols
        - Many challengers for sketch, demand for specialized tools
            - Figma – web based tool, not mac-only.
                - manages repeated "components" natively, then shares them in a library for your team
        - Managing a library for ui requires better version control
            - historically bad in design tooling
            - Abstract – sketch plugin for version control
        - Sharing design with whole org?
            - UXPin - docs for organisation to view your ui 
- Component-Oriented design
    - Devs on same journey for a number of years
        - Semantic HTML + Deeply nested CSS + Unobtrusive JS
            - Separation of concerns
            - Made sense for document-oriented development
        - React was turning point for component-based thinking.
    - FEs are thinking like designers
    - Thinking about separation of concerns has shifted to vertical
    - Sharing code across projects?
        - Used to be a lot harder than today
            - Copy + Paste -> NPM
            - Webpack, CSS Modules, CSS-in-JS
        - Modular code is easier than ever
            - Sharing is easier too
                - npm publish - shares this; publishing to npm is free
            - More common than ever, too
                - devs now want to create open source code
                - >586,000 packages of code, with own docs and readmes
                - Tech powering the world's biggest companies is available for free
- Creating styleguides is easier than ever
    - Storybook, Styleguidist
- Open Source culture
    - Leverage a variety of experiences and skill, globally.
    - Requires process
        - PRs to master
        - Notifications to slack
        - All changes approved by two others
        - Every change gets its own preview deployed
        - Automatic testing too
        - Every release automatically updates docs
    - Open cross-team collaboration
- Continuous design pipeline
    - At any time you should be able to see what a current snapshot of Seek design looks like
    - You need people to look after this, treat DesignOps as a real product
        - The hardest part about it isn't building it, it's keeping it alive and thriving
- Shifting the culture change is difficult
    - A design system isn't a project, it's a product serving products
    - Developers are the primary consumers of your product
- How do we feed back into the design process?
    - Continuous delivery for design assets
    - Git repo is the source of truth
    - Code and design needs to be in same repo
        - true integration with development workflow
        - Kactus
            - Manage sketch files with git
            - You can start to think of sketch files as code
        - Automatically publish sketch files to your guide's site
        - Canonical sketch files for components
    - One repo, two sources of truth - sketch file + code
        - Needs shared primitives, same materials
            - React community might have solution in react primitives
            - React natives allows js devs to build native ios apps, wrapping the imperative apis
                - Airbnb applied this to design tools – React-sketchapp
                    - Render react files to sketch
    - Cross-disciplinary design systems
- We're still just designing pictures, not products 
    - Designing an interface is still just drawing pictures, wrong medium
    - Haiku
        - animation tool
        - builds real primitives in a browser, exports real react components
    - Component oriented design tools building in the materials of the web, not imitating them
- Higher level design?
    - Modulz Studio - follow on twitter
        - online in-browser design tool
    - Compositor suite
        - Dragging and dropping components in a tree, not absolutely position
    - Interplay
        - Draws from living styleguide in npm
    - More to come...
- The next gen of design tools will be built on a layer of functional components
    - Investing in your DesignOps as a product allows us to future proof
- What does this mean for UI dev?
    - While innovation is important, the real challenge is education
        - Understand what's changing and where we're heading
        - Working towards true collaboration between design and dev
        - The best product is designed by teams with good bridges between design and dev

## Ben Birch & Tim Churchward - Style guides, so hot right now
- Long journey discovering different methods and modes of documenting their designs
    - word document, google docs, confluence...
    - Eventually moved to a style guide.
- Moved to Design system in 2015
    - Blessing from business
    - Open source contribution model
        - Core Devs + Experienced contributors + Consumers
        - "Librarians" were the core of the team, who did the requirements research
- Future states stored in Confluence, current state stored in live docs.
    - This helped global collaboration
    - Difficult to make decisions with entire team, individual contribution and communication is essential
- Started out thinking "we're building bootstrap for aconex"
    - glad we didn't
    - When you're building a pattern library/design system, you're designing for your company specifically
    - Building rich components that integrate tightly into your application
- Not about capturing every component
    - About innovating, and moving fast, while capturing the brand, culture and processes in company too.

## Erwin Van Der Koogh - 'Serverless' Back end development for front end developers
- Division from developers into front end and backend
    - And then split out further into languages and technologies
    - We need to come back together again
- AWS Lambda
    - Event handler
        - Listens for an event, replies when appropriate
    - Easy to write a lambda in many different languages, but we'll do in JS
    - 5 mins setup, 12 hours first hurdles
    - Acces to all AWS apis.
        - Dynamo DB - Key/value store
        - s3
        - RDS
        - Image recognition software
    - Amazon takes care of scaling
        - any number of requests at a time are possible, email amazon to get over 100
    - Much cheaper than servers
        - $5-8 for 1m requests/year
        - not worrying about servers? priceless
    - Convergence of development
        - JS easy to make fun of, but easy to learn and community is huge
        - Writing JS everywhere is extremely powerful
        - Component-based thinking
            - Self contained
            - Contains both behaviour and state
            - Hierarchy
            - Coherent on multiple levels

## Josh Duck - Exploring Static Types: Writing Typesafe Code that Feels Like Real JavaScript
- What are static types? Do we need them? How do they work?
- Does JS need to be strongly typed?
    - Not intended for its current use
        - "one liners" vs full web apps
    - Need confidence in our development
- We already use types in js
    - Guards at the top of functions
    - Comments for params and return types
    - hungarian notation
    - Object oriented code
- There's a difference between code that solves one case, and one that robustly solves many problems
- Flow and Typescript
    - TS - Microsoft, JS like
        - Strict, syntactic superset - not truly js, adds features
        - compiler produces js
        - Opts for developer experience over soundness - allows for some type errors
    - Flow - Facebook
        - still needs compilation, but is js with annotation.
        - "Sound" - strict, breaks if has type errors
    - IDEs can give you type-related info if they know type
- Static type shows errors early
- Value = Positives - Negatives

## Amelie Lamont - Don't Kill them Softly: Fostering a culture of fearless feedback
- It's important to all be very open re: feedback
    - An aggregation of information you're observing, then taking that information and giving it to the person who needs to receive it/is being observed.
    - We're not taught how to give it
    - We're not taught how to receive it
        - "Your design sucks". "wow i hate you"
        - often emotional
    - Feedback is _not_ a binary – it's on a spectrum
        - only you can control your reaction to this feedback
    - We're not emotionally equipped to handle feedback
        - Giving and receiving feedback is a skill
        - Apple had "fearless feedback"
            - fostered environment to say what you want to say when is appropriate
    - Feedback is information about reaction to a product, person or task, used for a basis of improvement.
        - Effective feedback is... 
            - Constructive
                - There's feedback that can help you or harm you. Helping you is constructive.
            - Consistent
                - To improve as a company, ask for feedback constantly. 
                    - "Yearly" to "quarterly" is not consistent improvement
            - Timely
                - In the moment the event happened, to ensure effect and context
            - Specific
                - "That wasn't very good" -- What are you talking about?? More specifics are more effective
            - Cooperative
                - A two-way conversation, trying to get to a resolution.
    - Giving feedback
        - We're all bad at it.
            - What is your intetion in the feedback?
                - Easy to give feedback as vengeance.
                - Often times when you're thinking about the feedback you're giving someone, make sure it's not coming from a malicious place
            - Can you ask for permission?
                - Receiver is well within their right to say no. This sets a precedent for absorbing feedback.
            - Are you looking at the person or their behaviours?
                - Behaviour unaligned to company values != a bad person
            - Are you being direct? Are you being specific?
                - "I noticed you're not on time. Can you tell me more about that? Is everything ok?"
            - How are you delivering feedback?
            - Don't make assumptions
                - e.g. There are a variety of reasons for being late. Not necessarily incompetence.
            - Are you providing both positive and corrective/directive feedback?
                - Are you letting them know what they're doing well? How they can be better?
            - Is the feedback factual? Or interpretive?
                - It's easy to have your own perspective and turn that into feedback on them.
                    - "I noticed you're not here in time for standup" != "I noticed you don't care about this project or the team"
                - Quantitative over qualitative.
            - How will this feedback impact the person or organization?
            - How will this feedback help this person grow?
        - For managers: Think of power structures
            - When giving feedback as managers, you have to consider how you come off when giving feedback. You can either make or break their career.
            - Your people can't grow without feedback.
                - Your reports need to know what they can be doing better
            - Be fair and create transparent structure
                - As a manager, you have to ensure the feedback is the same for everyone across the board
    - Receiving Feedback
        - Doesn't have to be scary
        - Be open to feedback you receive
            - it's possible that it won't be delivered in a way you like
        - Try your best to listen and do nothing
        - Try your best to dig deeper and find answers
        - Feel free to remove yourself from the situation
            - I don't want to be here right now, i need some space to think about it
        - Follow up
        - Decide if you want to take the feedback or not
            - "Thanks for that, but i'm not interested"
        - For Managers
            - Invite feedback from your direct reports
            - Just coz you're managing a team, doesn't mean you're above feedback
    - Crafting a culture of feedback
        - Feedback culture is necessary for feedback
            - "Who are you to tell me this?"
        - Create boundaries and guidelines
            - Set rules, maybe around how, when to give feedback... Whether the feedback is public or private
        - Focus on building relationships
            - Giving feedback in a bad relationship doesn't work
            - Giving feedback to a manager who doesn't like you might give you a negative consequence
        - Create elements of safety and trust
        - Be open to failure, mistakes and change
            - It's possible that people will mess up when giving feedback.
            - Feedback is a muscle, you may not deliver it right on the first try, but that's part of the process.
        - Do your best to assume positive intent
            - It's very easy to assume people giving feedback are out to get you
        - Allow people to build each other up, regardless of power structure
            - No Negativity Sandwiches
        - Sometimes people receiving feedback are stubborn and resistant, you have to dig in to intentions
    - Remaining open
        - often times you might not receive feedback the way you want it, it's up to you to be better in receiving it
